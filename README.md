# Traffic flow simulation

Brief description of the project: In this project we want to study traffic flow and how congestion emerges. We use the Nagel Schreckenberg model to study phase transitions and potentially the intelligent driver model to study more realistic details of traffic flow.

# Some research questions we could flesh out the project with:

Phase Transitions in Traffic Flow: How does the Nagel-Schreckenberg model exhibit phase transitions between different traffic flow regimes (e.g., free flow, synchronized flow, congested flow), and what are the critical parameters governing these transitions?

Self-Organizing Criticality in Traffic Dynamics: Can the Nagel-Schreckenberg model exhibit self-organizing criticality, where traffic dynamics naturally evolve to a state where small perturbations propagate across the system, leading to avalanches of congestion or flow interruptions?

Power Law Behavior in Traffic Congestion: Investigating whether the distribution of traffic congestion events in the Nagel-Schreckenberg model follows a power law distribution, and if so, what underlying mechanisms drive this behavior and how it relates to self-organizing criticality.

Impact of Network Topology on Phase Transitions: How does the topology of the road network influence the occurrence and characteristics of phase transitions in traffic flow dynamics simulated by the Nagel-Schreckenberg model?

Criticality and Resilience: Examining how self-organizing criticality in the Nagel-Schreckenberg model affects the resilience of traffic networks to perturbations, and identifying strategies to enhance system robustness in the face of critical events.

Dynamic Phase Transitions: Exploring how phase transitions in the Nagel-Schreckenberg model evolve dynamically in response to changing environmental conditions, traffic demand, or infrastructure modifications.

Scaling Laws in Traffic Dynamics: Investigating whether scaling laws emerge in the Nagel-Schreckenberg model, where certain traffic flow properties (e.g., traffic density, flow rate) exhibit scale-invariant behavior across different spatial and temporal scales.

Phase Transitions in Multi-Agent Systems: How do phase transitions manifest in multi-agent versions of the Nagel-Schreckenberg model, where individual vehicles adapt their behavior based on local interactions, and how does this influence overall traffic flow patterns?

Robustness of Power Law Behavior: Assessing the robustness of power law behavior in the Nagel-Schreckenberg model under different model assumptions, parameterizations, and variations in network structure.

Phase Transitions and Control Strategies: Investigating how control strategies such as traffic signal timing, speed limits, or lane management influence the occurrence and characteristics of phase transitions in traffic flow dynamics simulated by the Nagel-Schreckenberg model.
